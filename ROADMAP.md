## üì± Mobile-First Streaming Strategy

### Core Questions to Resolve

**1. Streaming Architecture**
- **Local Server Model**: Run lightweight server on mobile device
  - ‚úÖ Pros: True local-first, no cloud dependency
  - ‚ùå Cons: Battery drain, complex P2P discovery
- **Hybrid Model**: Local + cloud sync for cross-device
  - ‚úÖ Pros: Best of both worlds, seamless switching
  - ‚ùå Cons: More complex, requires cloud infrastructure
- **Cloud Streaming**: Traditional centralized approach
  - ‚úÖ Pros: Simple, proven, good for sharing
  - ‚ùå Cons: Vendor lock-in, privacy concerns

**Recommendation**: Start with Hybrid Model - local server for home network, cloud sync for mobile

**2. Offline Strategy**
- **Smart Caching**: ML-based prediction of what user will play
- **User-Controlled**: Let users pin albums/playlists offline
- **Hybrid Approach**: Automatic + manual controls

**Recommendation**: User-controlled with smart suggestions

**3. Cross-Device Sync**
- **Real-time sync**: WebRTC or WebSocket for instant updates
- **Eventual consistency**: Sync when devices connect
- **Conflict resolution**: Last-write-wins vs merge strategies

**4. Mobile Performance Targets**
- Stream start: < 500ms on 4G
- Offline access: < 100ms
- Battery life: < 5% drain per hour of playback
- Data usage: < 1MB per song on auto-quality

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 2A: PWA Foundation (2 weeks)**
- Service worker for offline support
- Web app manifest for native feel
- Basic mobile UI with touch controls
- Media session API integration

**Phase 2B: Streaming Optimization (2 weeks)**
- Adaptive bitrate based on connection speed
- Smart preloading and caching
- Background sync when online
- Battery optimization

**Phase 2C: Cross-Device Sync (2 weeks)**
- Device discovery on local network
- Playlist and library sync
- Playback state synchronization
- Conflict resolution

## üìä Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets
- Library import: < 5 minutes for 10k songs
- App startup: < 3 seconds
- Search results: < 200ms
- User retention: > 80% after importing library

### Phase 2 Targets
- Mobile stream start: < 500ms
- Offline availability: 99% for cached content
- Battery usage: < 5% per hour
- Cross-device sync: < 10 seconds

### Phase 3 Targets
- Comment engagement: > 20% of tracks
- Creator adoption: 100+ active uploaders
- Social shares: > 50% of listening sessions

## üéØ Current Sprint Priorities

### High Priority (Next 4 weeks)
1. Album art integration and display
2. iTunes library import functionality
3. Performance optimization for large libraries
4. Mobile PWA foundation

### Medium Priority (Weeks 5-8)
- Mobile streaming implementation
- Cross-device sync architecture
- Basic social commenting infrastructure

### Low Priority (Future)
- Advanced creator analytics
- Revenue sharing implementation
- Third-party integrations

## üö® Critical Decisions Needed

1. **Mobile Architecture**: Hybrid local+cloud vs pure local-first
2. **Streaming Protocol**: Custom vs standard (HLS/DASH)
3. **Monetization**: How to sustain without subscriptions
4. **Creator Economy**: Revenue sharing model and implementation

## üìù Key Differentiators

- **No subscription fees** - one-time purchase or freemium
- **True ownership** - your music, your data, your control
- **Creator-first** - better tools and revenue sharing than SoundCloud
- **Privacy-focused** - local-first with optional cloud features
- **Cross-platform** - seamless desktop to mobile experience
